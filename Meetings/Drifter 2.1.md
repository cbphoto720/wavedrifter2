## Updates
- Drifter 2.1 is operational.
	- Everything is barebones.  Drifter is collecting IMU, RAW GPS, and NMEA GGA data and can broadcast any info we need back to base station.
- 
- Working on MAVLink code to polt data in MissionPlanner
- Working on Bat voltage sensor

## WIP
- Base station in MissionPlanner app
## Questions
- is there any budget left to spend?
	- [ ] new HAL effect sensors (non-latching) (or just design better clearance for the reed switches)
	- [ ] more mini GPS antenna
	- [ ] Passive components (capacitors, Power delivery PCB board? {rout power, caps for RFM, HAL effect sensor SMD})
- Any experience with Sparkfun QWIIC cables?  I am leaning toward soldering everything Point-to-point
